birdears documentation
**********************

Welcome to birdears documentation.

"birdears" is a software written in Python 3 for ear training for
musicians (musical intelligence, transcribing music, composing). It is
a clone of the method used by Funcitional Ear Trainer app for Android.

It comes with four modes, or four kind of exercises, which are:
"melodic", "harmonic", "dictation" and "instrumental".

In resume, with the *melodic* mode two notes are played one after the
other and you have to guess the interval; with the *harmonic* mode,
two notes are played simoutaneously (harmonically) and you should
guess the interval.

With the *dictation* mode, more than 2 notes are played (*ie*., a
melodic dictation) and you should tell what are the intervals between
them.

With the *instrumental* mode, it is a like the *dictation*, but you
will be expected to play the notes on your instrument, *ie*., birdears
will not wait for a typed reply and you should prectice with your own
judgement. The melody can be repeat any times and you can have as much
time as you want to try it out.

Installing birdears
===================


Installing the dependencies
---------------------------


Arch Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

   sudo pacman -Syu sox python python-pip


Installing birdears
-------------------

To install,simple do this command with pip3

   pip3 install --user --upgrade --no-cache-dir birdears


In-depth installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to use a virtualenv to use birdears; this should give
you an idea on how to setup one virtualenv.

You should first install virtualenv (for python3) using your
distribution’s package (supposing you’re on linux), then issue on
terminal:

   virtualenv -p python3 ~/.venv # use the directory ~/.venv/ for the virtualenv

   source ~/.venv/bin/activate   # activate the virtualenv; this should be done
                                 # every time you may want to run the software
                                 # installed here.

   pip3 install birdears         # this will install the software

   birdears --help               # and this will run it

* instrumental dictation question

To see the commands avaliable just invoke the command without any
arguments:

Loading from config/preset files
--------------------------------


Pre-made presets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"birdears" cointains some pre-made presets in it’s "presets/"
subdirectory.

The study for beginners is recommended by following the numeric order
of those files (000, 001, then 002 etc.)


Pre-made presets description
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*write me*


Creating new preset files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open the files cointained in birdears premade "presets/"
folder to have an ideia on how config files are made; it is simply the
command line options written in a form "toml" standard.


Keybindings
-----------


On the keybindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following keyboard diagrams should give you an idea on how the
keybindings work. Please note how the keys on the line from "z"
(*unison*) to "," (comma, *octave*) represent the notes that are
*natural* to the mode, and the line above represent the chromatics.

Also, for exercises with two octaves, the **uppercased keys represent
the second octave**. For example, "z" is *unison*, "," is the
*octave*, "Z" (uppercased) is the *double octave*. The same for all
the other intervals.

birdears.interval module
------------------------

class birdears.interval.ChromaticInterval(mode, tonic, octave, n_octaves=None, descending=None, valid_intervals=None)

   Bases: "birdears.interval.IntervalBase"

   Chooses a diatonic interval for the question.

   tonic_octave

      *int* – Scientific octave for the tonic. For example, if the
      tonic is a ‘C4’ then *tonic_octave* is 4.

   interval octave

      *int* – Scientific octave for the interval. For example, if the
      interval is a ‘G5’ then *tonic_octave* is 5.

   chromatic_offset

      *int* – The offset in semitones inside one octave; maybe it will
      be deprecated in favour of *distance[‘semitones’]* which is the
      same.

   note_and_octave

      *str* – Note and octave of the interval, for example, if the
      interval is G5 the note name is ‘G5’.

   note_name

      *str* – The note name of the interval, for example, if the
      interval is G5 then the name is ‘G’.

   semitones

      *int* – Semitones from tonic to octave. If tonic is C4 and
      interval is G5 the number of semitones is 19.

   is_chromatic

      *bool* – If the current interval is chromatic (True) or if it
      exists in the diatonic scale which key is tonic.

   is_descending

birdears.questions.instrumentaldictation module
-----------------------------------------------

class birdears.questions.instrumentaldictation.InstrumentalDictationQuestion(mode='major', wait_time=11, n_repeats=1, max_intervals=3, n_notes=4, tonic=None, octave=None, descending=None, chromatic=None, n_octaves=None, valid_intervals=None, user_durations=None, prequestion_method='progression_i_iv_v_i', resolution_method='repeat_only', *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: "birdears.questionbase.QuestionBase"

   Implements an instrumental dictation test.

   __init__(mode='major', wait_time=11, n_repeats=1, max_intervals=3, n_notes=4, tonic=None, octave=None, descending=None, chromatic=None, n_octaves=None, valid_intervals=None, user_durations=None, prequestion_method='progression_i_iv_v_i', resolution_method='repeat_only', *args, **kwargs)

      Inits the class.

      Parameters:
         * **mode** (*str*) – A string representing the mode of the
           question. Eg., ‘major’ or ‘minor’.

         * **wait_time** (*float*) – Wait time in seconds for the
           next question or repeat.

         * **n_repeats** (*int*) – Number of times the same
           dictation will be repeated before the end of the exercise.

         * **max_intervals** (*int*) – The maximum number of random
           intervals the question will have.

         * **n_notes** (*int*) – The number of notes the melodic
           dictation will have.

         * **tonic** (*str*) – A string representing the tonic of
           the question, eg.: ‘C’; if omitted, it will be selected
           randomly.

         * **octave** (*int*) – A scienfic octave notation, for
           example, 4 for ‘C4’; if not present, it will be randomly
           chosen.

         * **descending** (*bool*) – Is the question direction in
           descending, ie., intervals have lower pitch than the tonic.

         * **chromatic** (*bool*) – If the question can have (True)
           or not (False) chromatic intervals, ie., intervals not in
           the diatonic scale of tonic/mode.

         * **n_octaves** (*int*) – Maximum number of octaves of the
           question.

         * **valid_intervals** (*list*) – A list with intervals
           (int) valid for random choice, 1 is 1st, 2 is second etc.
           Eg. [1, 4, 5] to allow only tonics, fourths and fifths.

         * **user_durations** (*str*) –

           A string with 9 comma-separated *int* or *float`s to set
           the default duration for the notes played. The values are
           respectively for: pre-question duration (1st), pre-question
           delay (2nd), and pre-question pos-delay (3rd); question
           duration (4th), question delay (5th), and question pos-
           delay (6th); resolution duration (7th), resolution delay
           (8th), and resolution pos-delay (9th). duration is the
           duration in of the note in seconds; delay is the time to
           wait before playing the next note, and pos_delay is the
           time to wait after all the notes of the respective sequence
           have been played. If any of the user durations is `n*, the
           default duration for the type of question will be used
           instead. Example:

              "2,0.5,1,2,n,0,2.5,n,1"

         * **prequestion_method** (*str*) – Method of playing a
           cadence or the exercise tonic before the question so to
           affirm the question musical tonic key to the ear. Valid
           ones are registered in the
           *birdears.prequestion.PREQUESION_METHODS* global dict.

         * **resolution_method** (*str*) – Method of playing the
           resolution of an exercise. Valid ones are registered in the
           *birdears.resolution.RESOLUTION_METHODS* global dict.

   check_question()

      Checks whether the given answer is correct.

      This currently doesn’t applies to instrumental dictation
      questions.
