## What is Functional Ear Training

### The method

## birdears modes

birdears actually has four modes:

* melodic interval question
* harmonic interval question
* melodic dictation question
* instrumental dictation question
* load from config file

### basic usage

To see the commands avaliable just invoke the command without any arguments:

```
birdears
```

```
$ birdears
Usage: birdears  <command> [options]

  birdears â”€ Functional Ear Training for Musicians!

Options:
  --debug / --no-debug  Turns on debugging; instead you can set DEBUG=1.
  -h, --help            Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  dictation     Melodic dictation
  harmonic      Harmonic interval recognition
  instrumental  Instrumental melodic time-based dictation
  kivy          Starts birdears graphical user interface...
  load          Loads exercise from .toml config file...
  melodic       Melodic interval recognition
  urwid         Starts birdears text user interface (using...

  You can use 'birdears <command> --help' to show options for a specific
  command.

```

There are five commands, which are `dictation`, `harmonic`, `instrumental` and
`melodic` and `load`.

You can play the default question for these by starting birdears with one of
these commands, or you can check the `--help` for additional options for each
of the commands, invoking this way:

```
birdears <command> --help
```

### melodic

In this exercise birdears will play two notes, the tonic and the interval
melodically, ie., one after the other and you should reply which is the
correct distance between the two.

```
birdears melodic --help
```

```
$ birdears melodic --help
Usage: birdears melodic [options]

  -v, --valid_intervals <1,2,..>  A comma-separated list without spaces
                                  of valid scale degrees to be chosen for the
                                  question.

  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.

  In this exercise birdears will play two notes, the tonic and the interval
  melodically, ie., one after the other and you should reply which is the
  correct distance between the two.

  Valid values are as follows:

  -r <resolution_method> is one of: nearest_tonic, repeat_only
```

### harmonic

In this exercise birdears will play two notes, the tonic and the interval
harmonically, ie., both on the same time and you should reply which is the
correct distance between the two.
