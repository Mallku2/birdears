The Functional Ear Training method consists in educating the ear to listen to
musical tones.

The method is following:

first, we will play a cadence to stablish the key to the ears 

for example, the cadence of I-IV-V-I in the key of C major:
`C - F - G - C`

second, we will play a random note inside that given key

third, the student will be taught to:

1. resolve the given note to the tonic below (unison) if the note is in the range from
the unison to the fourth

2. resolve the given note to the tonic above if the note is in the range from
the 5 (dominant) to the octave

3. currently, the +4. -5 is being resolved to the greater octave. This can change in 
a near future.
